# BEMT-Based Propeller Design

## Overview
This project focuses on the design and analysis of a **marine propeller** using the **Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT)**. The objective was to develop an optimized propeller geometry by applying BEMT principles and then model the final design.

## Project Details
- **Methodology:** BEMT was used to determine the optimal blade shape and performance characteristics.
- **Modeling:** The final propeller design was created using CAD software.
- **Analysis:** Performance parameters such as thrust, torque, and efficiency were evaluated.

## Files
- `BEMT_Calculations.xlsx` – Excel sheet with the calculations for the propeller.
- `Propeller.png` – Rendered image of the final propeller design.
- `Propeller2.png` – Alternative view of the propeller.
- `Report.pdf` – Detailed explanation of the methodology, calculations, and results.

## Key Aspects of the Design
- **Blade Element Theory (BET):** Dividing the propeller into small elements to analyze forces.
- **Momentum Theory:** Evaluating induced velocities and optimizing performance.
- **Thrust and Torque Predictions:** Using BEMT equations to estimate propeller behavior.
- **Efficiency Analysis:** Ensuring optimal power conversion.

## Results and Model
- The optimized propeller was designed based on BEMT calculations.
- The final shape was modeled in **CAD software**.
- Performance metrics were evaluated, and improvements were suggested.
